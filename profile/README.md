## Downloads

Welcome! This is the new site for the products formerly known as Delegat Foundation and Delegat SOAR and their component repositories. Some of these have been open-source for a long time and can be used stand-alone; see the listing of public repositories to see what's available. You'll also find a few of them pinned below.

## Foundation & SOAR

To install `OpenSecOps Foundation` and `OpenSecOps SOAR`, clone the repo [Installer](https://github.com/CloudSecOps-Org/Installer) and follow the instructions in its README. You will also find complete installation instructions and all manuals in the `docs` directory.

## Website

Don't miss our website at [https://opensecops.org](https://opensecops.org) which contains lots of material describing Foundation and SOAR, including technical information and elevator pitches tailored to different  stakeholders.
