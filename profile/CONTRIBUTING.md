# Contributing to OpenSecOps

First and foremost, thank you for considering contributing to OpenSecOps. This document outlines our stringent contribution process, which is designed to maintain the security and integrity of a software platform used in critical financial and security contexts.

## Security Context

OpenSecOps is deployed in production environments of financial institutions and other security-sensitive organizations with multi-billion dollar operations. As such, our contribution process emphasizes security and stability above all else.

## Security-First Principles

1. **Zero Tolerance for Security Compromises**: We maintain an absolute zero-tolerance policy for changes that might introduce security vulnerabilities.

2. **Rigorous Review Process**: All contributions undergo extensive security review by a panel of security experts.

3. **Controlled Evolution**: Changes are cautiously integrated to protect existing production deployments.

4. **Verifiable Security**: All code must have clear, traceable security properties and must not introduce new attack vectors.

## Contribution Process

### Before Contributing

1. **Understand the Context**: Familiarize yourself with the architecture and security principles of OpenSecOps.

2. **Create an Issue First**: Always create an issue discussing your proposed change before submitting code.

3. **Wait for Approval**: Do not begin work until a maintainer has approved your proposal.

### Security Requirements

All contributions MUST:

- Follow our secure coding guidelines
- Include appropriate tests
- Maintain or improve the current security posture
- Be minimally invasive to reduce risk of unintended side-effects
- Include a clear security impact assessment
- Pass all automated security checks

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code adheres to our style guidelines.
2. Update documentation to reflect any changes.
3. Include security considerations and testing in your PR description.
4. The PR title should clearly describe the security implications.
5. Be prepared to address detailed security questions during review.
6. All commits must be signed.

### Code Review

The code review process is especially thorough:

1. At least two maintainers must approve all changes.
2. Security-critical components require review by a security specialist.
3. Changes may undergo additional security testing before acceptance.
4. The review focuses on security, correctness, and maintainabilityâ€”in that order.

## Authorization to Merge

Only authorized maintainers can merge changes. The merge decision is based on:

1. Successful completion of all security reviews
2. Passing all automated tests
3. Alignment with the project's security principles
4. Minimal impact on existing stable deployments

## Recognition

Contributors who consistently provide high-quality, secure contributions may be invited to join the security review board or maintainer team after establishing a track record of responsible participation.

## Questions

If you have questions about the contribution process, please open a discussion rather than an issue. This keeps our issue tracker focused on actual code changes.

Thank you for respecting our stringent security processes. They exist to protect the critical systems that depend on this software.
