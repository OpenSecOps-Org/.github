# Security Policy

## Security Context

OpenSecOps is a security-critical platform used in financial services and other high-security environments by organizations handling billions of dollars in transactions. The security of this software is paramount, and we take all security concerns extremely seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:

**[security@opensecops.org](mailto:security@opensecops.org)**

Please include the following information in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any potential mitigations you've identified

## Response Process

When you report a vulnerability, our security team will:

1. Acknowledge receipt of your report within 24 hours
2. Provide a preliminary assessment within 3 business days
3. Work with you to understand and validate the issue
4. Develop and test a fix for validated vulnerabilities
5. Coordinate the release of security updates
6. Publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (if desired)

## Security Review Process

All code in OpenSecOps undergoes rigorous security review, including:

- Static code analysis
- Dynamic security testing
- Manual security review by experts
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Validation against common attack vectors

## Security Updates

Critical security updates will be released as soon as they are validated and tested. Non-critical security enhancements may be bundled with regular releases.

We are committed to maintaining the security integrity of all versions currently in use by our community.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all repositories within the OpenSecOps-Org GitHub organization.

## Security Expectations

Contributors and users should:

- Keep their environments secure and updated
- Never share API keys or credentials
- Follow secure deployment best practices
- Implement defense-in-depth security principles
- Report any security concerns promptly through the proper channels

We appreciate your help in keeping OpenSecOps and its users secure.
